// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

ask for number i
if number is divisible by 2 i%2 == 0
	print this number is even
else print this number is odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

ask for 5 separate numbers

calculate the average (a+b+c+d+e)/5
find smallest num   min(a,b,c,d,e)
find largest num   max(a,b,c,d,e)

print on screen this is the average X, smallest num X, largest num X
